PythonGenerator:
 replace basestring & long with str and int (inside docstring), then reduced (int,int)
 comment out OverflowError int()
 replace file with f, exec(f) with exec(f.read()
replaced ObnjectKey.__cmp__  with ObjectKey.__eq__ accroding python3porting


#find . -type f -name "Settings*.config"| xargs perl -p -i -e 's/^([{}])/#\1/'^C
temporarlilfy commented out MiscUtils/Configurable.py
  "Configuration via a dict literal is not supported any mor"
#reverted 20191204 as configs rewritten and not needed anymore


TBD: MiscUtils/MixIn.py needs patch or clone?
   #if isinstance(member, (MethodType,+FunctionType) ):
            if callable(member):

Design/SQLGenerator swapped not null / default (Firebird 2/3 needs this)

TBD: 2 Fails MKTypeValueChecking :see PythonGenerator, cant work because there no longs anymore
Problem with long/int, long was marker for "ObjRefType"

Tested with python3.6 und python3.8 (windows only)

TBD: from . import FixPath ##is this still needed? PYTHONPATH, venv
TBD: WebBrowser MixIn deactivated
